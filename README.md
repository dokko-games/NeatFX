# WinForJUI
WinForJUI is a library that makes working with visual interfaces on java easier, by removing the
use of java's default library **_swing_** and having to prepare your applications for different
window resolutions and input handling or crash handling.

## Why?
Java's **_Swing library_** is outdated and confusing for beginners. Other libraries like JavaFX are hard to install
and finally, more low-level libraries like OpenGL or Vulkan are extremely complicated,
especially for a programmer that is just getting started with java.<br>
<br>For That reason, I made **Win4JUI**, a library that takes the good stuff of the most common UI methods in the language and 
mixes them to create the best framework possible.

## Usage
To make a basic app, you must first make a simple Main class, like in any java program, and add the following code to the main method:
```java
int monitorWidth = ; // your screen's width
int monitorHeight = ; // your screen's height
Win4JUI.setDeveloperScreenSize(monitorWidth, monitorHeight);
Win4JUI.initialize();

String windowTitle = ; // the window's title
int windowWidth = ; // the window's width
int windowHeight = ; // the window's height
int windowFramerate = ; // the amount of times the window will refresh every second. Use 15-60 normally
Window4JUI window = new Window4JUI(windowTitle, windowWidth, windowHeight, windowFramerate);
window.setVisible(true);
```
